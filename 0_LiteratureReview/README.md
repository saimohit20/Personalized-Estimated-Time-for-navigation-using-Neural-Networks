#### **Source 1**: Bicycle Data-Driven Application Framework: A Dutch Case Study on Machine Learning-Based Bicycle Delay Estimation at Signalized Intersections Using Nationwide Sparse GPS Data

  - **https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/24/9664#**
  - **Objective**: Develop a generic data-driven framework for estimating average bicycle delays at signalized intersections using sparse GPS cycling data. This helps assess transportation system performance. The study evaluates machine learning models such as random forest, k-nearest neighbor, and neural networks, combining GPS data with public information like weather and intersection complexity. It aims to enhance traffic management, bicycle policy, and infrastructure planning by providing insights into cyclist behavior and delays.
  - **Methods**: Key methods include processing sparse GPS data collected at signalized intersections, utilizing feature engineering to extract traffic-related insights, and training predictive models to estimate delays. The framework integrates advanced statistical analysis and real-world transportation data from the Dutch traffic system to enhance its reliability
  - **Outcomes**: The study demonstrates that machine learning models, particularly random forests, can effectively estimate bicycle delays at signalized intersections using sparse GPS data and publicly available information. It highlights how factors like weather and time of day impact delays, offering insights for infrastructure improvements and traffic management. Recommendations include refining delay definitions, expanding intersection coverage, incorporating local signal and traffic data, and enhancing sensor accuracy. These improvements can optimize traffic management and policy-making, contributing to better cycling experiences and infrastructure planning
  - **Relation to the Project**: The paper emphasizes deriving travel insights through predictive modeling of travel behavior. While it uses GPS data to estimate bicycle delays, we can adapt machine learning models like random forests to achieve accurate travel time predictions in our project. Additionally, incorporating bicycle delay factors into our travel time estimation model could enhance accuracy, aligning with the paper's methodology to improve traffic and infrastructure planning.

#### **Source 2**: The Development of a Predictive Hiking Travel Time Model Accounting for Terrain Variations

  - **https://gispoint.de/fileadmin/user_upload/paper_gis_open/537521059.pdf**
  - **Objective**: To develop a predictive hiking speed model accounting for terrain variations.This predictive travel time model could be used in adventure travel planning, wild land accessibility evaluation, and emergency response evacuation planning to name a few. The potential of using hiking data collected via hand held 
of 40 hikes represented by global positioning system (GPS) data were downloaded from an outdoor adventure travel website to be used in the study.
  - **Methods**: They aimed to create a hiking speed model using GPS data by testing different mathematical equations like (linear, quadratic, cubic, compound, logistic, growth, and exponential equations) to understand how slope affects speed. The researchers compared their model with existing ones, like Tobler’s and Langmuir’s, which adjust for elevation changes. They applied Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to refine their predictions, analyzing speed variations across various terrains.
  - **Outcomes**: The GWR analysis improved the model’s accuracy, achieving an R² of 0.5255, meaning slope alone explains 52.55% of the hiking speed. This better fit suggests that slope-speed relationships vary across locations, and GWR accounts for this by using local data samples weighted by distance. This process smooths out extreme values, making the model more reliable and better suited for real-world conditions.
  - **Relation to the Project**:Reinforces the value of GPX data for predictive model training and help us to understand the methods to incorporate rider variability into travel time predictions. Offers insights into leveraging terrain and environmental data for accuracy. Aligns with using machine learning to improve model performance. Provides a framework adaptable for your dataset of 9 riders.

#### **Source 3**: Bike Share Travel Time Modeling: San Francisco Bay Area Case Study

  - **https://doi.org/10.1109/MTITS.2017.8005582**
  - **Objective**: The study explores predictive modeling of bike-share travel times in the San Francisco Bay Area, using random forest (RF), least square boosting (LSBoost), and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques. With 33 predictors like distance, weather, and time of day, RF models achieved the best performance (MAE: 84.01 seconds; MAPE: 16.92%). Key factors affecting travel time include travel distance, subscription type, time of day, weekends, temperature, and humidity. The research highlights RF's superiority and emphasizes weather's role in bike travel time variability.
  - **Methods**: To develop the most accurate travel time prediction model, several statistical and machine learning techniques were evaluated. Initially, multiple linear regression (MLR) was employed as a baseline approach. Subsequently, advanced machine learning methods, including random forest (RF), least square boosting (LSBoost), and artificial neural networks (ANN), were investigated. These techniques were systematically compared to identify the most accurate model. This section outlines the methodologies applied to analyze the data.
  - **Outcomes**: Random forest (RF) models outperformed other techniques, including LSBoost and ANN, in predicting bike travel time. Using RF and forward stepwise regression, the key predictors identified were travel distance, subscription type, time-of-day, Saturday, mean temperature, mean humidity, and Sunday. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, were also found to significantly impact bike travel time.
  - **Relation to the Project**: In the BSS even though the data was limited to stations and service areas the main study and methodolgy was focused on bicycle travel time. Further the models used in this paper can be tested with our data set considering the variables used are same.
